      <description>WHAT IS DOCKER ? To put it simply, Docker is a way of packing &amp;amp; distributing software.
WHY DO WE NEED DOCKER ?  Let&amp;rsquo;s say your are building a Python application using Django. You can provide list of Python dependencies/packages needed for the project inside requirements.txt file. Let&amp;rsquo;s say one of the dependency is celery. For celery to work it will need a backend ( let&amp;rsquo;s say we are using rabbitmq as backend for celery) For the project to work on a system you will have to install rabbitmq separately.</description>
